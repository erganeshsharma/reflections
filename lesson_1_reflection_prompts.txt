How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Added lines are highlighted with a preceding + symbol.
And the lines that got removed are highlighted witha a preceding - symbol.  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If thinks break we can look out for older version to track the changes, or
we can even roll back to previous version if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros are it saves time, as unnecessary commits are avoided.
We can control when to commit and how often.
Cons are, its hard to track if the commits are not regular.
There are chances that the user forget to commit timely after every change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git works offline as well and it works manually as well.
While Google Docs work online only and it works automatically.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

$git log // to print the log history
$git diff commit1 commit2 to print the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

We can roll back any time to previous stable version of the product.And then try later.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To manage my repositories in github and work with them.
