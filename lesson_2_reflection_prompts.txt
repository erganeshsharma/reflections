What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository using "git init" command, a .git file is created inside the directory. Now on every changes can be control with git. We can see the status and log of the git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate area where the added files are stored, which are yet to commit.
We can remove added files from staging area using "git reset filename". Working directory contains all the files and subdirectories but the staging area contains only the files and subdirectories that are added but yet to commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and the repository.
So, after changing the existing file or creating a new file, add those files to the staged area and then commit each one or a group of file to repository with a meaningful commit message.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when you want to work on the code without disturbing the master branch. Or to try some experimental work on the code, without disturbing it by creating a new experimental branch. So to add some features into the working software. Once your branch code seems to be working fine, we can merge them to the master branch.
So it is very helpful to work on large code base.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
