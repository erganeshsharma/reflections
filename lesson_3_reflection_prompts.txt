When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Keeping remote repository is handy when you are collaborating with someone
 remotely and both of you are working on same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
For better control, as we keep on experimenting and developing so we don't want to push or pull everything. Once we satisfied that the code is working properly, only then its better to pull.

Describes the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is cloning/coppying others repository on github onto your own git hub repositories.
Clonning is downloading the repository from github to your local machine.
New Branch is created to experiment or develop new features without disturbing the stable master branch.
Once done, we can merge the newly created branch to reflects the changes made into the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps us to combine conflicting changes from multiple people.
We can manually correct the conflict and then merge the branches.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub, we need to share each and every changes we made with every collaborator for approval.
It would have been very difficult to track the approval and changes required.
Git and GitHub make it easy for collaborators to be on same page and
monitor the changes and merge or pull request.
Reviewing is very easy with Git and GitHub.
Keeping older version of code is also very easy.
Collaborators can revert back to older version any time.
